# Explanation:
# This file is a sub app for the elective enroll application
# It is specified for students
# Only students can view these pages
# The First Route Below makes sure that the requester of this app, student_mod, is a student
# If not, the user is redirected to the index page of the 'elective' app itself
# The name of this app is elective_student
# Every individual app on flask has its own name
# Its sub apps have the name '%PRIMARY_APP_NAME%_%SUB_APP_NAME%'
# These names are useful because they can be used to get urls of routes
# For example, url_for('elective.index') would return the route with the function named index

# Checks whether the requester
